A Neural Network Model to Forecast Cryptocurrency Prices with Python.

The model initially reads the cryptocurrency values from the yahoo API and initially predicts the prices for the next 30 days based on the first 60 days.
Further we have used this model to predict the price for the next day after the 90th day.
Note: In this model, ETH cryptocurrency and INR currency are compared and the values in terms of INR are predicted.
